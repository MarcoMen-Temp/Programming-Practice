## Project Issues

The issues encountered in this project were encountered towards the end, as I was trying to put on my Jupyter Notebook a TOC ( Table Of Contents ) with hyperlinks to redirect to certain sections within the notebook. I managed to achieve this through HTML syntax code in Markdown cells in my notebook. Example, <a id ='top' />(redirection cell) and [Back To Top](#top)(hyperlink) and same rule applicable to TOC items linking to different parts of the text. I created  multiple HTML <a id='keyword' /> for multiple sections ( with different 'keyword' for each section ) and hyperlinks within the TOC.
The reasons I wanted to include such feature was for better layout and presentation, but mainly for its navigation functionality
I was unable to obtain my desired outcome in GitHub after git push commands(even though on my actual notebook it worked), I decided to not include a TOC.
Another issue encountered on GitHub was the fact that half way through the project, the GitHub repositories were not rendering the notebooks displaying an error message, which a few of us found stressing. We soon found out it was GitHub internal issue and it was resolved within days.

## Lessons Learned

I included this in my conclusion. But in a nutshell, I have learned a bit of numpy package, matplotlib ( especially mathText and LaTex ) and also how to better format plots and graphs by setting parameters for matplotlib. I also jogged my memory on my knowledge of probabilities and statistics.
