    "\n",
    "These are variables that can be generated by the possible outcomes.It can only be an integer.Example,heads or tails on a coin flip. If you count the number of heads or tails,you will never get 4.35 times tails(only an integer). So the number of heads or tails is a discrete variable\n",

Anyone outside the weight requirements need not apply. So the weights are continuous along that interval(or range) of values.\n",

    "The t distribution and the normal distribution can both be used with statistics that have a bell-shaped distribution. This suggests that we might use either the t-distribution or the normal distribution to analyze sampling distributions. Which should we choose?\n",
    "\n",
    "Guidelines exist to help you make that choice. Some focus on the population standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the population standard deviation is known, use the normal distribution\n",
    "If the population standard deviation is unknown, use the t-distribution.\n",
    "Other guidelines focus on sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the sample size is large, use the normal distribution. (See the discussion above in the section on the Central Limit Theorem to understand what is meant by a \"large\" sample.)\n",
    "If the sample size is small, use the t-distribution.\n",
    "In practice, researchers employ a mix of the above guidelines. On this site, we use the normal distribution when the population standard deviation is known and the sample size is large. We might use either distribution when standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is very large. We use the t-distribution when the sample size is small, unless the underlying distribution is not normal. The t distribution should not be used with small samples from populations that are not approximately normal.\n",
