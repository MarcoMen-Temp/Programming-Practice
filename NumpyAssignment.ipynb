    "In practice, researchers employ a mix of the above guidelines. On this site, we use the normal distribution when the population standard deviation is known and the sample size is large. We might use either distribution when standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is very large. We use the t-distribution when the sample size is small, unless the underlying distribution is not normal. The t distribution should not be used with small samples from populations that are not approximately normal.\n",

On the numpy documentation, the PDFs are provided which are correct,but for the purposes of random sampling from those distributions we must understand CDFs(Cumulative Density Functions). We can plot the density functions for the different probability distributions,by adding the function expressions(**equations**) in our code to plot the PDF on top of the histogram of frequency.
